      <h2>Air Quality Hits Severe Levels</h2>
      <p>
        On <strong>December 13, 2025</strong>, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) breached the 400 mark,
        slipping into the <em>“severe”</em> category. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)
        immediately enforced <strong>Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)</strong>,
        banning construction and demolition activities across the NCR.

      <h2>Local Emissions Driving Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        Recent analysis shows that <strong>local emissions</strong>—from vehicles, industries, and
        everyday activities—are now the primary drivers of Delhi’s winter smog, even as farm fires
        have declined. Smaller NCR towns like Ghaziabad and Bahadurgarh are experiencing intense smog,
        highlighting the expanding pollution hotspots.
